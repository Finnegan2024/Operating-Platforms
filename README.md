# Operating-Platforms

#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was our client who wanted to develop a web-based game based off of their current game, Draw It or Lose It, to serve to various platforms other than Android. The Gaming Room did not have the adequte expertise to set up the new environment and contracted us to faciliate the development. My role was to prepare the softrware design document and develop the application.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I ensured all components of the software design document were concise and lucid. This was achieved by completing the executive sumamry, identifying constraints, and comparing and contrasting operating platofrms to determine the best platform for our server while simultaneously ensuring all aspects of the platforms were taken into consideration throughout the devleopment of the game.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found the evaluation and recommendation portions especially helpful as they determined key differences and similarites between operating platforms while suggesting the best platform to use for the development of Draw It or Lose It.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation portion as the layout for this section was a bit awkward and led to fragmented thoughts. I would improve the layout of the evaluation section to create a more sequential and comprehensive explanation of operating platforms.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I discussed requirements with the client while also assessing their active game to understand what constraints were involved and solutions for possible problems. The user is the ultimate end consumer and they'll dictate whether an application will succeed or fail. They are the lifeline of any project and must be heard to deliver the maximum amount of value and relevancy.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Firstly, I took a holistic approach to understanding the game and its various aspects. I then determined a proper architecture to implement which gave me a course of action and in conjunction to a java framework, I was able to create an application that followed industry standards and meet my users' needs and requirements. This simple set of steps is what I'll use in the future to analyze and design similar applications as I have a rough idea of how to implement software strategies.
